  bigaPercent: "Biga is a low-hydration preferment that adds complexity, strength, and digestibility.",
  bigaHydration: "Biga hydration, usually between 45-50%. Low hydration slows fermentation and develops flavor.",
  finalHydration: "Hydration affects dough softness and crispiness. Higher hydration means more extensible dough.",
  saltPercent: "Salt strengthens gluten and slows fermentation. Typical range is 2–3.5%.",
  maltPercent: "Malt or sugar feeds the yeast and aids browning in low-temp ovens.",
  bigaTime: "Time the biga ferments before being mixed into the final dough.",
  bigaTemp: "Cold fermentation for 24-48 hours @ 4-6°C, room temp usually 16-24 hours @ 18-22°C.",
  doughTime: "How long the final dough rests before baking.",
  doughTemp: "Temperature of the final dough fermentation environment.",
  yeastType: "Choose between IDY, fresh, or liquid yeast. This affects the yeast % calculation.",

  ingredientBreakdown: "Yeast % is estimated based on temp, time, and yeast type. Biga and Refresh yeast are calculated separately.",
