    title: "Prepare Biga",
    timeKey: "prepBigaTime",
    instructions: "Combine yeast and water and give it time to hydrate. Then incrementatlly mix with the flour, gently mixing together without kneeding. Let the dough rest covered at 18°C–20°C for the full rise time. The biga should have a pleasant smell. Over fermented biga will develop more acids which will in trun break down the gluten and make the dough weak. Cool and slow is best for longer fermetation, and development of more complex flavor. Generally 16-20 hours is a good time if fermenting at room temp 0r 18-22C."

    title: "Autolyze",
    timeKey: "autolyzeRefreshTime",
    instructions: `When the biga is almost ready mix the remaining flour with the water gently untill it just comes together. Cover and leave to rest for 30-60 minutes. In this time the flour hydrates and develops gluten. It will feel elastic at the end of this autolysation.`

    title: "Prepare Dough",
    timeKey: "prepDoughTime",
    instructions: `Hydrate the yeast with a little water, and let sit to activate. You can also mix in some malt to kickstart the yeast.Take the biga out of the fermentaion vessel, break it into smaller pieces an dput in mixer. Add the autolysed flour mix together with the biga. tip in the yeast with the water it was hydrating in. Add malt, and a little more water. Start mixing, slowly adding water a little at a time until the bowl becomes clean. Adding a little more each time it becomes clean. In a spiral mixe rthis can be 5-8 minutes on slow. Add salt to left over water, then into to dough and mix until smooth and elastic. It will start to pop as air gets caught in the dough while it mixes. Rest briefly, covered for 15 minutes. Then do some stretch and folds to bring it together, and into a ball. Put in a lightly oiled container, and leave until doubled in size.`

    title: "Prepare Dough Balls",
    instructions: `Turn dough out onto clean surface. Handle the dough with lightly oiled, or wet hands to prevent sticking. Divide and weigh the dough into your preferred ball weights. Gently form the dough balls, trying to leave as much air in the dough. Put in your proofing container/s. Proof untill the balls have doubled in size. Adding flour to dough as you work with it will change the hydration so it is not ideal. Better to work with slightly wet or oiled hands.`

    instructions: `While dough balls rest at room temperature, prepare your toppings. Keep ingredients chilled and ready for fast assembly.`

    title: "Baking Time",
    timeKey: "bakePizza",
    instructions: `I turn my balls out into a large bowl of semolina, turning the balls. The top of your pizza balls will be the top of you pizza. At this point you will know if you have overfermented.Is  you have, it will be weak and will not hold together as the gluten will be broken down by the acids in the dough. It will also have a tendency to stick to you oven floor. Underfermented dough will be hard to stretch, as the gluten will be stong. Stretch each dough ball into a circle, leaving air in the sides of the pizza base. This will be your crust. Add toppings, and bake immediately. Bake each pizza until the crust is blistered and golden, about 2–4 minutes.`
